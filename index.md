Hi I'm [SREccardo](https://x.com/sreccardo) aka [palladius](https://x.com/palladius).

As a Rubyist, I built this site with Jekyll.

Pushes to http://blog.palladi.us/ are made through Github pages:

1. **Netlify**. I just started on 17nov24.
    * [jekyll-sreccardo.netlify.app](https://jekyll-sreccardo.netlify.app/) WRONG
    * https://sreccardo-blog.netlify.app/ CORRECT
    * Pointing to this new amazing theme: `.themes/feeling-responsive/`
    * Currently broken.
2. **github pages**:
    * Github actions: https://github.com/palladius/palladius.github.io/actions
    * Goes to: [palladius.github.io](https://palladius.github.io/) (ugly no CSS)
3. **GCP**. I believe there's a third thingy on GCP where I dockerize and push to `blog.palladi.us`, I just can't recall from which Cloud Build :)

## Bugs

Looks lovely in localhost, but super ugly when deployed from Netlify and in my docker way. Dont know why.

Some CSS settings maybe?

# Icons

I love UTF-8 emojis like:

* ☝️  1 command to install
* 👨‍💻 Ready to production and local development #sifaperdire
* ⚡  Performance Optimized
* 🔒 SSL auto-renewed
