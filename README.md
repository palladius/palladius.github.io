# Ricc Jekyll website

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/fcb66aec-9841-45ec-90b6-951e47808d88/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/sreccardo-blog/deploys)

Self:

* SRC Repo: https://github.com/palladius/palladius.github.io/
* DST Blog: http://blog.palladi.us/
* DST Netlified into: https://sreccardo-blog.netlify.app/
* RiccDoc: go/pbt-rickywiki

Folder organization:

* All jekyll files under `blog/`
* Everything that helps building it is outside except what NEEDS tp be there like entrypoint.

## Vision

As of Oct 2024, this is becoming part of my greater vision go/ricc-rikiwiki: write once, use Gemini, push everywhere.

## Image Gallery

* https://olivierpieters.be/blog/2016/02/26/creating-a-jekyll-image-gallery
* install deps w/ bower: see `OTHER-IDEAS.md`

## Auto-build

Not sure if it works at all. Looks like its stuck.

## productionization

See `OTHER-IDEAS.md`

## Themes

By default I use `minima`. Some free ones I like:

1. https://jekyllthemes.io/theme/minimal-mistakes 12.4k stars on [github](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes).
2. https://jekyllthemes.io/theme/online-cv 3.2k stars on [github](https://github.com/sharu725/online-cv). Great for a CV online
3. https://jekyllthemes.io/theme/feeling-responsive 898stars on [github](https://github.com/Phlow/feeling-responsive)

Maybe I could start with the first one?
