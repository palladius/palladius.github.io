# Ricc Jekyll website

Self:

* Repo: https://github.com/palladius/palladius.github.io/
* Blog: http://blog.palladi.us/
* RiccDoc: go/pbt-rickywiki

Folder organization:

* All jekyll files under `blog/`
* Everything that helps building it is outside except what NEEDS tp be there like entrypoint.

## Vision

As of Oct 2024, this is becoming part of my greater vision go/ricc-rikiwiki: write once, use Gemini, push everywhere.

## Image Gallery

* https://olivierpieters.be/blog/2016/02/26/creating-a-jekyll-image-gallery
* install deps w/ bower: see `OTHER-IDEAS.md`

## Auto-build

Not sure if it works at all. Looks like its stuck.

## productionization

See `OTHER-IDEAS.md`

## Credits

* Olivier Pieters (me@olivierpieters.be') for his beautiful jekyll gallery which I'm using.
